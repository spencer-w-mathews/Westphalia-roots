Story
    Our Story
    Westphalia Roots was God inspired. It began as my daughter , Lori, dreamed of having her own
    greenhouse to supplement her income. My husband knew that the USDA had a program to
    help. Ed and Lori visited other USDA greenhouses and dreamed and schemed about where to
    place, what to grow and endless possibilities. In 2018, we applied for the USDA program. If
    approved, we told Lori it would be her baby, we’d help her get it built but it would be hers to
    plan and use to supplement her income. We were approved for the program and it is a good
    program but labor intensive. I worked fulltime as a nurse and Ed is a very fulltime row crop
    farmer. The greenhouse construction was done as time and weather allowed. It was a family
    project. And if it was not for access to some heavy equipment and awesome help from my sons
    , I am not sure how we would have completed it. We picked up the greenhouse parts in April
    2019 and were finally finished in June 2020! As God would have it, Lori married and moved to
    Austin in August 2019. She nor her husband are able to drive and it just wasn’t feasible for her
    to manage the greenhouse from 90 miles away. Ed and I joked about what to do with the 96 by
    36 unheated high tunnel greenhouse, he suggested filling it with tomatoe plants or chickens.
    That was a definite no in my book!
    I retired after 35 years as an RN in August of 2019, just before Lori married. Covid hit in 2020. I
    was able to keep 2 of my grandkids as their daycare shut down. Life settled back into some
    normalcy for us in August of 2020. I was chopping around trees down our tree lined drive
    talking to God about what He wanted me to do with this season of my life. Very clearly, He said
    “I want you to spread joy” And in my usual fashion, I explained to God that I was kinda shy and
    an introvert and I didn’t think I was the right person for the job. And, God said “With flowers”
    And, I thought, I can do that! And, so it began. I began to research flower farming. It was a real
    thing! I had no idea. I started following Lisa Mason Ziegler, took her online soil blocking course
    and devoured her Cool Flowers book and planted my first seed in Oct 2020. In January 2021, I
    took the Floret Online course, met some other local folks just starting this journey as well. I
    met with Katy at Sage Moose an established and inspiring flower farmer in Stephenville Texas
    who was a Floret alumi
    My goal for 2021, was to see if I could get flowers to grow. God had bigger plans-not only did
    flowers grow despite a 100 year record freeze, a 30 minute golf ball sized hail storm and
    excessive rain. My family, friends and the local community have been incredibly supportive of
    this dream. God showed me that not only could I grow His beautiful flowers but that I could
    create arrangements as well. It has been an amazing journery.
    I have met some incredible people on this journey. And, I can talk flowers with a passion. I
    have been able to spread JOY through flowers. And, I am loving it!
     Tidbits
     I would have been a more supportive farmer’s wife if I had started flower farming
    sooner
     I feel I am a temporary caretaker of the beauty that God has created in flowers and
    nature
     My 5 yo grandson knows the difference between a dahlia and a zinnia and can do the
    zinnia wiggle test!

     My husband has been a huge help..physically with getting things done and his
    knowledge of how to amend the soil, recognizing what a growing plant needs and
    seeing insect damage way before I even see a problem. And knowing how to treat it
    organically. My dream is that he retires from row crop farming and becomes a fulltime
    flower farmer. It’s not his dream, yet.
     My goal with this website is to spread more JOY. There is such joy in giving and this ole
    world needs more Joy!
     Sustainable farming, organic, support local, reuse/recycle
    CALl to Action:
    Spread joy through flowers, whatever the occasion!
